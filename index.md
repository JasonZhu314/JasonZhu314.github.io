## About Me

I am a sophomore at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, passionate about Mathematics and Deep Learning.

At present, my research interests lie in the deep integration of computational mathematics and AI, specifically
in scientific machine learning, optimization for deep learning, and reinforcement learning. I aim to develop
stable and efficient algorithms that leverage computational mathematics to advance deep learning models,
and to apply methods from AI to tackle challenging problems in computational mathematics, thereby promoting scientific
progress.

I am also involved in AI for Mathematics (AI4M) and have a vision of using AI to assist mathematicians in their research, such as automating the translation process from natural language to formal language such as Lean4 and the generation of new conjectures or proofs. I believe that AI and Mathematics have a bidirectional relationship, where AI can aid in mathematical research, and mathematical principles can enhance AI models, thereby fostering mutual development.
