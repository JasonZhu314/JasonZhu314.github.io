    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m a sophomore at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University, working at the intersection of <strong>computational mathematics</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>. My current interests include <strong>scientific machine learning</strong>, <strong>optimization for deep learning</strong>, and <strong>reinforcement learning</strong>.</p>
    <p>I aim to design stable, efficient algorithms that draw on mathematical structure to advance deep learning models, and to apply AI techniques to tough problems in computational mathematics.</p>
    <p>I’m also excited about <strong>AI for Mathematics</strong> (AI4M): tooling that helps mathematicians translate ideas into formal languages like Lean4, generate conjectures, and explore proofs with AI assistance.</p>
