## Introduction

Hello there! I'm Jitong (Jason) Zhu, a sophomore at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University. I have a strong passion for Mathematics and Deep Learning.

## Research Interests

At present, my research interests lie in the deep integration of **computational mathematics and AI**, specifically
in **scientific machine learning**, **optimization for deep learning**, and **reinforcement learning**. I aim to develop
stable and efficient algorithms that leverage computational mathematics to advance deep learning models,
and to apply methods from AI to tackle challenging problems in computational mathematics, thereby promoting scientific
progress.

I am also involved in **AI for Mathematics** (AI4M) and have a vision of using AI to assist mathematicians in their research, such as automating the translation process from natural language to formal language such as Lean4 and the generation of new conjectures or proofs. I believe that AI and Mathematics have a bidirectional relationship, where AI can aid in mathematical research, and mathematical principles can enhance AI models, thereby fostering mutual development.

## Hobbies

I enjoy reading, biking, and swimming in my free time. Sometimes I go on a ride with my friends during the weekends. I joined the school's swimming team this semester, and have participated in competitions in our school.

I was quite into mathematics competitions during my high school years, and was honored to win a gold medal in the Chinese Mathematical Olympiad (CMO). Now, long after my retirement from competitions, I still have fun in solving challenging mathematics problems just for fun.

In addition, although I have not participated in informatics olympiad during my high school years, I learned competitive programming as a hobby and attended Codeforces contests.
